# YouVersion Suggest Data

This repository consists of Bible language data gathered from the YouVersion
website, for use by my YouVersion Suggest [Chrome extension][chrome] and [Alfred
workflow][alfred].

All of this data is generated and follows a well-defined JSON format. The
generator and schema will be eventually included in this repository, but for
now, you can find them in [my original YouVersion Suggest repository][alfred].
